# YouTube Upload System - Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary
Date: 2025-08-25

### Problem
The YouTube upload system was failing with "Failed to process video" errors when users tried to attach video files. The root cause was that binary video data couldn't be serialized to JSON when storing in PostgreSQL BYTEA columns via Supabase's REST API.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Base64 Encoding for Storage**
   - Modified `create_video_reference()` to base64 encode binary data before storage
   - Files are now stored as base64 strings in the database

2. **Hex Decoding for Retrieval**  
   - PostgreSQL BYTEA columns return data as hex-encoded strings via JSON API
   - Updated `get_file_data()` to detect and decode hex format (`\x...`)
   - Convert hex → base64 → binary for proper data retrieval

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Added comprehensive error handling to `/api/youtube/prepare-upload`
   - 7-step validation process with detailed error messages
   - Better user-facing error messages for common issues

### Files Modified
- `/backend/services/youtube_file_service.py` - Core fix for base64 encoding/hex decoding
- `/backend/youtube_mcp/api.py` - Enhanced error handling in upload endpoints
- `/backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py` - Fixed indentation errors and added JWT regeneration

### Verification
All tests passing:
- ✅ Video reference creation works
- ✅ Base64 encoding/decoding works  
- ✅ Data integrity is maintained
- ✅ File type detection works
- ✅ Reference management works

### Current Status
✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - YouTube upload system is working correctly with the reference ID system for video uploads.
