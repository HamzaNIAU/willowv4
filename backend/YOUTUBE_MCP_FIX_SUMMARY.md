# YouTube MCP Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The agent wasn't recognizing YouTube channels when asked "what are my youtube channels". It was searching for YouTube in MCP servers instead of using the YouTube tools.

## Root Cause
YouTube channels displayed in the frontend dropdown were not being passed to the agent at runtime. The agent loads its configuration from the database, which doesn't include runtime-selected MCPs like YouTube channels.

## Solution
Implemented runtime MCP selection by passing selected YouTube channels from frontend to backend when starting an agent run.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `/backend/agent/api.py`
- Updated `AgentStartRequest` to accept `selected_mcps` parameter
- Added logic to merge runtime MCPs with stored agent configuration
- Deduplicates MCPs based on `qualifiedName` to avoid duplicates

```python
class AgentStartRequest(BaseModel):
    selected_mcps: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None  # Runtime MCPs
    # ... other fields
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- Updated `startAgent` function to accept `selected_mcps` in options
- Passes selected MCPs in the request body to backend

#### `/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/thread/[threadId]/page.tsx`
- Added `useAgentMcpConfigurations` hook to get MCP configurations
- Filters for enabled YouTube channels (social-media MCPs)
- Passes enabled YouTube MCPs when starting agent

```typescript
// Filter for enabled YouTube channels
const enabledYouTubeMcps = mcpConfigurations.filter((mcp: any) => 
  mcp.enabled && 
  mcp.customType === 'social-media' && 
  mcp.platform === 'youtube'
);
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend**: User toggles YouTube channels in the dropdown
2. **Frontend**: When sending a message, collects enabled YouTube MCPs
3. **Frontend**: Passes selected MCPs to `startAgent` API call
4. **Backend**: Receives selected MCPs in `AgentStartRequest`
5. **Backend**: Merges selected MCPs with agent's stored configuration
6. **Backend**: Passes merged configuration to agent runner
7. **Agent**: Initializes with YouTube MCPs and registers YouTube tools
8. **Agent**: Can now respond to "what are my youtube channels" correctly

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test_youtube_mcp.py` - Tests MCP configuration structure
- `test_youtube_integration.py` - Tests complete flow from frontend to backend

## Result
✅ YouTube channels are now recognized by the agent
✅ Agent can use YouTube tools (authenticate, channels, upload, stats)
✅ Runtime MCP selection works without modifying stored agent configuration
✅ No duplicate MCPs when merging runtime selections with stored config
