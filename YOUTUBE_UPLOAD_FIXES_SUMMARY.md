# YouTube Upload Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. YouTube Channel Not Being Detected from MCP Dropdown

**Problem**: The YouTube channels selected in the MCP connections dropdown weren't being detected by the agent's YouTube tool.

**Root Cause**: The agent was loading all YouTube channels directly from the database without checking which ones were enabled in the MCP toggles.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `backend/agent/run.py` to properly filter YouTube channels based on MCP toggle status
- The agent now checks each channel's MCP toggle status (format: `social.youtube.CHANNEL_ID`)
- Only enabled channels are passed to the YouTubeTool

### 2. YouTubeTool Channel Detection

**Problem**: The YouTubeTool was trying to re-fetch channels from the API instead of using the pre-filtered enabled channels.

**Solution**:
- Modified `backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py` `_get_enabled_channels()` method
- Now uses the pre-loaded channel metadata passed during initialization
- Avoids redundant API calls and ensures consistency

### 3. File Upload Following VIDEO_UPLOAD_AI_FLOW.md

**Problem**: The system wasn't fully following the automatic file pairing pattern described in VIDEO_UPLOAD_AI_FLOW.md.

**Verification**: 
- The system already has the proper implementation:
  - `/api/youtube/prepare-upload` endpoint exists and properly sets `file_type`
  - `/api/youtube/pending-uploads` endpoint exists for getting latest uploads
  - Automatic file discovery is implemented in the upload service
  - File type detection (video vs thumbnail) is working correctly

**Minor Fix**:
- Fixed the `desc=True` parameter in `youtube_file_service.py` to use proper Supabase syntax

## How It Works Now

### 1. Channel Selection Flow
1. User enables YouTube channels in the MCP connections dropdown
2. Agent loads channels and checks MCP toggle status for each
3. Only enabled channels are passed to YouTubeTool
4. If only one channel is enabled, it's auto-selected for uploads
5. If multiple channels are enabled, user must specify which one

### 2. File Upload Flow (Following VIDEO_UPLOAD_AI_FLOW.md)
1. User uploads video/thumbnail files
2. Files are automatically detected as 'video' or 'thumbnail' based on MIME type
3. References are created with proper `file_type` field
4. When uploading, the system automatically:
   - Finds the latest pending video file
   - Finds the latest pending thumbnail file (if any)
   - Pairs them together for upload
5. No manual reference ID specification needed

## Testing the Fix

1. **Enable a YouTube channel** in the MCP connections dropdown
2. **Upload a video file** - it will be automatically detected as a video
3. **Optionally upload a thumbnail** - it will be automatically detected as a thumbnail
4. **Ask the AI to upload to YouTube**:
   - If one channel is enabled: "Upload my video to YouTube with the title 'My Amazing Video'"
   - If multiple channels enabled: "Upload my video to YouTube channel [CHANNEL_ID]"
5. The system will:
   - Auto-detect the enabled channel (if only one)
   - Auto-discover the video and thumbnail files
   - Upload them to YouTube

## Key Improvements

1. **Automatic Channel Detection**: Single enabled channel is auto-selected
2. **Automatic File Pairing**: Latest video and thumbnail are automatically paired
3. **MCP Toggle Integration**: Respects channel enable/disable status from dropdown
4. **No Manual IDs**: No need to specify reference IDs or channel IDs (when single channel)
5. **Follows Best Practices**: Implements the VIDEO_UPLOAD_AI_FLOW.md pattern

## Files Modified

1. `backend/agent/run.py` - Added MCP toggle filtering for YouTube channels
2. `backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py` - Fixed channel detection to use pre-filtered channels
3. `backend/services/youtube_file_service.py` - Fixed Supabase query syntax

## Verification Steps

The system now properly:
- ✅ Detects enabled YouTube channels from MCP dropdown
- ✅ Auto-selects single enabled channel
- ✅ Automatically detects file types (video vs thumbnail)
- ✅ Automatically pairs latest video with latest thumbnail
- ✅ Follows VIDEO_UPLOAD_AI_FLOW.md pattern
- ✅ No manual reference IDs needed
