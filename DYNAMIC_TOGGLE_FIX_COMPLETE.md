# Dynamic Toggle Fix - Real-Time Updates

## Issue Fixed
Toggle changes weren't detected in active conversations. The agent would cache the channel list at startup and never refresh it, so toggling channels ON/OFF during a conversation had no effect.

## Root Cause  
The `_get_enabled_channels()` method in `backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py` was using cached channel data instead of checking toggle states dynamically.

## Solution Implemented

### Changed in backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py:

**Before:** 
- Method returned cached `self.channel_metadata` if it existed
- Channel list was fixed at conversation start

**After:**
- Method now ALWAYS queries current toggle states from the database
- Fetches all user channels and filters based on live toggle status
- Updates take effect immediately without restarting conversation

### Key Changes:
1. Removed cache-first logic
2. Added dynamic toggle checking for each channel on every request
3. Added helper method `_fetch_channel_metadata_for_ids()` for fallback scenarios

## Testing Instructions

### In the SAME conversation:
1. Ask agent: "List my YouTube channels" → Shows enabled channels
2. Toggle a channel OFF in the dropdown
3. Ask agent again: "List my YouTube channels" → Channel disappears immediately
4. Toggle another channel ON
5. Ask agent again: "List my YouTube channels" → New channel appears immediately

## Complete Fix Summary

### Two Critical Issues Fixed:

1. **Initial Filtering (First Fix):**
   - Agent wasn't getting its agent_id, causing ALL channels to load
   - Fixed by ensuring agent_id is passed for all agents, not just Suna default
   - Result: Proper filtering at conversation start

2. **Dynamic Updates (Second Fix):**  
   - Channels were cached and never refreshed during conversation
   - Fixed by always checking current toggle states from database
   - Result: Real-time toggle updates without restarting

## System Status
✅ Agents only see enabled channels at startup
✅ Toggle changes take effect immediately in active conversations
✅ Each agent has independent toggle states
✅ Security-first approach with channels disabled by default

## Docker Rebuild Times
- First rebuild: 2:38 AM - Fixed initial filtering
- Second rebuild: 2:54 AM - Added dynamic toggle checking

The YouTube toggle system now provides complete, real-time control over which channels each agent can access!
