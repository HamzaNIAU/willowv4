# YouTube Upload Auto-Select Fix

## Issue Fixed
The agent was explicitly passing disabled channel IDs to the upload function, causing uploads to fail even when enabled channels were available.

## Root Cause
The YouTube tool's schema didn't clearly communicate that:
1. The agent should NOT specify channel_id in most cases
2. The function has smart auto-selection logic for enabled channels
3. Passing a disabled channel will always fail

## Solution Implemented

### Changed in backend/agent/tools/youtube_tool.py:

1. **Updated main function description (line 493):**
```python
# Before:
"Upload a video to YouTube. Can automatically generate title and description..."

# After:  
"Upload a video to YouTube. Automatically selects from enabled channels when channel_id is not specified... IMPORTANT: Do not specify channel_id unless user explicitly requests a specific channel."
```

2. **Updated channel_id parameter description (line 499):**
```python
# Before:
"The YouTube channel ID to upload to (optional - uses first available channel if not specified)"

# After:
"The YouTube channel ID to upload to. DO NOT specify unless user explicitly requests a specific channel. Leave empty to auto-select from enabled channels. Specifying a disabled channel will cause upload to fail."
```

3. **Improved error message (lines 585-596):**
- Now suggests using auto-selection when a disabled channel is specified
- Lists available enabled channels in the error message

## How Auto-Selection Works

When no channel_id is provided:
1. Gets all enabled channels dynamically
2. If NO channels enabled → Shows error asking to enable channels
3. If ONE channel enabled → Auto-selects it for upload
4. If MULTIPLE channels enabled → Asks user to choose

## Testing Instructions

### Test the fix:
1. Enable only Hamzaontop channel
2. Say: "Upload a test video to YouTube with title 'Auto-select test'"
3. **Expected:** Agent should NOT specify channel_id, upload uses Hamzaontop automatically

### Test with multiple channels:
1. Enable both channels
2. Say: "Upload a video to YouTube"
3. **Expected:** Agent asks which channel to use

### Test explicit channel request:
1. Say: "Upload to my Bella AI channel" (with it disabled)
2. **Expected:** Agent specifies channel_id and gets proper error with suggestion

## Complete Fix Summary

Three critical issues have been resolved:

1. **Initial Filtering** ✅ - Agents only see enabled channels at startup
2. **Dynamic Updates** ✅ - Toggle changes take effect immediately  
3. **Upload Auto-Selection** ✅ - Agents use smart auto-selection instead of guessing

## Docker Rebuild
- Containers rebuilt at 3:17 AM on 8/20/2025
- All services running with the complete toggle system fixes

The YouTube integration now provides seamless, intelligent channel selection with proper security and real-time toggle control!
